Groundhog Lite
------------------

Goal of the device is:
- collect light data in the backyard
- Upload collected light data to a personal computer
- Last on battery power for at least ~1 day

===============
= Behavior    =
===============
- place coin cell battery in device
- switch device to battery power source (as opposed to usb power source)
  - usb power source is off switch as long as there is no USB attached
- Place the device outdoors
  - status light should be blinking to say "everything is good" or "recording" or "active"
- Wait...
- Pick up the device, turn it off by moving switch over to USB power source
- Plug it into the computer via USB
- using an application, download the data to the computer
- when the device dies, you will not see a light flashing when its on

  - Notes

* - STM32L431RCT6
  - Low power 32-bit ARM CPU. Used to collect and store sensor information.
  - 1.8V - 3.3V Range 
  - TODO
  - I2C, USB, DAC, SWD
  - Need to confirm if this is the correct CPU to use. Confirm how many inputs can go into DAC.

* - Photoresistor (e.g. SEN-09088)
  - Resistor that is sensitive to light. Use for sensor information.
  - N/A, its a resistor
  - N/A, its a resistor
  - Analog 
  - Potentially use voltage divider to measure sensor data. Use multiple photoresistors to get directional light data. Depends on how many inputs can go into DAC.

* - Status LED
  - Used to communicate device state 
  - N/A passive device
  - N/A passive device
  - Analog
  - Communicates error & state

* - Power LED
  - Used to communicate power supply is on & working
  - N/A passive device
  - N/A passive device
  - Analog
  - Communicates regulator

* - FRAM (FM24V05-GTR) 
  - Used to store data  
  - 2.0V - 3.6V
  - 175 uA active current
  - I2C
